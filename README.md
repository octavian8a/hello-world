Feel the Bern
Programming off and on for 49 years.  It has been real.  Just did move from Windows to Linux, free at last.  Well installed Redhat in 1995, it was more of a feat back then, but no print driver so never used it.  Twnenty-five years later using Linux, still working on the printer but looks promising.  Funny computers should be tools but I spent all my time getting the computer to teach me what I want it to do.  I don'thave any kids to teach me.
