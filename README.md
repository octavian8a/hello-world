Feel the Bern
Programming off and on for 49 years.  It has been real.  Just did move from Windows to Linux, free at last.  Well installed Redhat in 1995, it was more of a feat back then, but no print driver so never used it.  Twnenty-five years later using Linux, still working on the printer but looks promising.  Funny computers should be tools but I spent all my time hacking my system  so it can learn me what I want it to do.
